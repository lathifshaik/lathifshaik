# Hey, I’m Lathif 👋

**AI Systems Engineer | Multi-Agent Architect | Full-Stack Builder**

I build production-ready AI systems — not demos.

Most of my work focuses on turning large language models into real, usable products.  
I design agentic workflows, ship full-stack applications, and wire models into scalable systems that people actually use.
