# hey, i’m lathif 👋

i’m a software engineer who likes building things with ai and the web.  
most of my time goes into wiring llms into real products and shipping stuff people actually use.[page:1]

---

## what i’m into

- ai + agents – llms, langchain, agentic workflows, local models with ollama.[page:1]
- full‑stack – python, react, typescript, fastapi, node, postgres.[page:1]
- infra – aws, docker, a bit of devops to get things from laptop → prod.[page:1]
- community – helping founders, students, and builders use ai in practical ways.[page:1]

## a few projects

### hurricane ai agent
an autonomous agentic coding assistant that runs locally on ollama.[page:1]  
it has multiple agents (coder, tester, reviewer, etc.) that plan and execute tasks together, with git, docker, pytest and more wired in.[page:1]

→ repo: `github.com/lathifshaik/Hurricane`[page:1]

### zen ai @ workzen
custom llm engine for talent evaluation and matching at an ai‑powered recruitment platform.[page:1]  
handled candidate scoring, matching, and plugged into real products like workzen.cc and jobs.workzen.cc.[page:1]

### oribo

- backend: fastapi, node.js, rest apis, microservices.[page:1]
- frontend: react, a bit of next.js, html/css.[page:1]
- ai: llms, langchain, huggingface, tensorflow, cv, unsupervised learning.[page:1]
- infra: aws, docker, ci/cd, postgresql.[page:1]

## beyond code

- i write a weekly newsletter called **tech crunch** – a 5‑minute read on ai, startups, and tech.[page:1]
- i hang around melbourne/sydney meetups, workshops, and random ai events.[page:1]
